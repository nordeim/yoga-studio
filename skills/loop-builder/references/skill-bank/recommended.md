# skill-bank — recommended (curated standouts)

A curated catalog of proven external skills/plugins/workflows worth borrowing when
building a loop. Pointers only — nothing here is vendored. Each entry is tagged by the
loop block it can serve: (1) scheduling, (2) isolation, (3) skill/conventions,
(4) connectors, (5) verifier, (6) state. Borrow by recommend-and-record: cite the
source + install pointer + a named fallback; never inline external code. Sources and
the refresh procedure live in `sources.yml`. This file is the **curated standouts** —
the entries the skill-bank search sub-agent prefers. It is not loaded directly each
build; in Phase 1.5 loop-builder dispatches a searcher (see
`references/skill-bank/search-agent.md`) that reads this file plus the comprehensive
`catalog/<source>.md` listings and returns the best-fit shortlist.
